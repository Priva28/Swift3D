 # Welcome to Swift3D!
 
 Hello, my name is Christian!
 
 I’m someone who absolutely loves SwiftUI. I have been using it constantly since it came out in 2019 and it’s power and ease of use is what really ignited my passion for Swift development.

 Creating views that were reusable with simple declarations meant anyone could quickly learn how to make anything from a simple view with text that says “Hello World!” to a fully featured app.

 2D is great, but in our future, we are going to need something that will let us create 3D application just as easily for use on either a screen or in AR. I set out on a goal to create a concept of what this could be like and how the features and power of the Swift language could make this possible. The perfect place to do this is in a Swift Playground!
